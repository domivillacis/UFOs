# UFO Sightings

## Overview of the analysis

This analysis is based on the creation of a web page with detailed information on UFO sightings.

For this web page, we will obtain the data from a JavaScript array and we will create a dynamic table that is friendly and that allows filtering the information according to the criteria that each user needs.

As we know, JavaScript is a coding language designed to enhance HTML, therefore we will work with these two languages together to customise and create our webpage.

## Results

To improve the functionality of our page and facilitate the search for specific data, we have added multiple filters in addition to the "Enter date" filter:
- city
- state
- country
- shape

By entering values into each field and then either with a click or enter, our table will automatically filter and return only the required results.

Navigating our website is very exciting and super easy. Another feature that the page has is that after applying the filters, if we want to see the whole table again, instead of deleting filter by filter, we can simply click on "UFO Sightings" and that will allow our filters to reset.

To better show how the filters work, we have created an explanatory video
