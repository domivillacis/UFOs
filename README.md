# UFOs

## Overview of the analysis

This analysis is based on the creation of a web page with detailed information on UFO sightings.

For this web page, we will obtain the data from a JavaScript array and we will create a dynamic table that is friendly and that allows filtering the information according to the criteria that each user needs.

As we know, JavaScript is a coding language designed to enhance HTML, therefore we will work with these two languages together to customise our webpage.

## Results

To improve the functionality of our page and facilitate the search for data, we have added multiple filters in addition to the "date" filter:
- city
- state
- country
- shape

By entering values in each field, automatically, either with a click

Navigating our website is very exciting and super easy. Another feature that the page has is that when going into multiple filters, if we want to go back to see the whole table, instead of deleting filter by filter, we can just click on "UFO Sightings" and that will allow our filters to reset.

To better show how the filters work, we have created an explanatory video
