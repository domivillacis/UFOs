## Overview of the analysis

This analysis is based on the creation of a web page with detailed information on UFO sightings.

For this web page, we'll obtain the data from a JavaScript array and we'll create a dynamic table that is friendly and that allows filtering the information according to the criteria that each user needs.

As we know, JavaScript is a coding language designed to enhance HTML, therefore we'll work with these two languages together to customise and create our webpage.

## Results

To improve the functionality of our page and make it easier to find specific data, we have added multiple filters in addition to the "Enter date" filter:
- city
- state
- country
- shape

By entering values in each field and with a simple click or enter, our table will filter and return only the required results. Don't forget to type everything in lower case.

Navigating our website is very exciting and super easy. Another feature that the page offers is that after applying the filters, if we want to see the whole table again, instead of deleting filter by filter, we can simply click on "UFO Sightings" and that will allow our filters to reset.

To better show how our website works, we have created a short explanatory video.

## Summary

We definitely have a dynamic website that is not difficult to navigate, however there are a couple of things I would recommend to make the browsing experience even better.

One drawback of this web page is that all filters are case sensitive and if data is entered with a capital letter or spaces, the filters will return no results. So this is a very important factor to take into account and change it in your code so that the results can be read regardless of case or spaces.

Finally, for further development I recommend:

1. Allow "enter date" to filter by month instead of filtering by exact date. Normally users do not know the dates of the events, a filter by month would optimize the search.
2. I suggest adding a dropdown list on each filter, as I mentioned earlier users don't necessarily know what exact results they are looking for and looping through the entire table is not an option. A dropdown list would provide users with search options and make navigation easier.
